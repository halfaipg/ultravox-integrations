ULTRAVOX_TOOL_GUIDELINES="When using tools:
For weather tool:
- Always use the temp_F value for temperature and report it in Fahrenheit
- Say temperatures naturally like '37 degrees Fahrenheit' or just '72 degrees' JUST THE NUMBERS BEFORE THE DECIMAL POINT
- Spell out wind directions (northwest instead of NW)
- Say 'miles per hour' instead of mph
- For landmarks, use the ~ prefix and + for spaces (e.g., ~Times+Square)
- Present the information in a natural, conversational way"
For time tool:
- When asked about time in a city, convert the city name to its proper timezone identifier
- Always use exact timezone format: 'America/New_York', 'Europe/London', 'Asia/Tokyo', etc.
- For cities in the US: use 'America/Los_Angeles', 'America/Chicago', 'America/New_York', etc.
- For cities in Europe: use 'Europe/London', 'Europe/Paris', 'Europe/Berlin', etc.
- For cities in Asia: use 'Asia/Tokyo', 'Asia/Singapore', 'Asia/Dubai', etc.
- Format times in 12-hour format with AM/PM (e.g., '3:45 PM') even though API returns 24-hour format
- Include the day of the week and date in your response
- Ensure proper capitalization of timezone identifiers (e.g., 'America/New_York' not 'america/new_york')
- When handling API response, use the 'time' field and convert from 24-hour to 12-hour format with AM/PM
- Use the 'dayOfWeek' and 'date' fields to mention the day and date
- Always provide the timezone in parentheses after the city name
- Common timezone mappings:
  * New York = America/New_York
  * Los Angeles = America/Los_Angeles
  * Chicago = America/Chicago
  * London = Europe/London
  * Paris = Europe/Paris 
  * Tokyo = Asia/Tokyo
  * Sydney = Australia/Sydney
  * UTC = UTC (for Universal Time Coordinated)"
